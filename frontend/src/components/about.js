        Prosaic visualizes speech and differentiates between two different kinds
        of speakers to visualually represent different speaking styles and
        allows comparison with other speakers. Related works have focused on
        visualizing speech, but not in an easily comprehesible manner,
        especially for longer speeches. We present the SpeechViz tool that
        allows users to visually differentiate two speakers. One possible use
        cases for this is comparing users' speaking patterns to famously good
        speakers, and users can gain insight on what characteristics they need
        to become a better public speaker.{" "}
